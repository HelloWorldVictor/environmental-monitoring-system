# Environmental Monitoring System CLI

This is a simple, command-line interface (CLI) application built with Python to monitor environmental data like air quality and weather conditions. It fetches real-time data from public APIs, stores it in a local SQLite database, and alerts the user if readings exceed pre-configured safety thresholds.
